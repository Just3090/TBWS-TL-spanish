Looks like you messed up your application. Don't worry, it's nothing major.
In the part on clubs you put "not necessary" .
Look man, I get it. That's time where you could be doing better stuff, but clubs are mandatory my dude.
There should be a list of clubs in the envelope, you just gotta pick one and join it. Super easy.
I know you're just getting settled in, so I pulled some strings for you.
You have a week to decide on your club.
           
Anyways, catch you later man. You're gonna have fun here!

Wow, I can't believe it. 6 years old already?
It's absolutely flown by, but you know what they say, time flies when your daughter is as wonderful as you are.
I have to say, I wasn't quite sure what to get you this year, I doubt it will compare to any of your mother's amazing presents.
But! I think I've found something. You may have inherited your beauty and kind soul from your mother, but you got {i}my{/i} love of reading and writing.
I know I read far too slowly for you, so I thought that maybe we should start giving you your own books to read. Starting with my favourite.
This was the very same book my old man gave to me, so I want you to take very good care of it. Though, I know you will.
           
One last thing, always remember Yuri
You are a very special girl, you will grow to be an amazing woman who does amazing things...
Go travel the world, visit the most beautiful places, see wonders people can only dream of!
Then, if you have the time...
Bring something back for your old man.

Love forver and always, your dad. xoxo
           
PS. You should read this to Hiro, I think he'd enjoy it. (Your voices will never be as silly as mine though!)."""

I think he'd be proud to see how wonderful you've become.

The statue stands tall, cold, lifeless.
A stone reflection of a man who casts an enormous shadow.
But the statue doesn't know it. It only knows the stillness of the room.
It's great marble splendour is it's own iron shackles.

What would it take to free the statue?
If it were freed, would it live a full life?
Or would it chase the footsteps of the man who's image it was made of?
I don't know. Neither I fear, does the statue.

But still it stands, a marvel to us all.
Even if I can't help the statue, it has helped me.

Like, royally screwed up.

You remember when I said I peeked at the code?

Well it was pretty bad then, but one night, I got curious. So I peeked again.

It gets so much worse. Like, have you seen the dreams Yuri and MC have been having?

Plus their violent tendencies as well… 

It's not just them either, everyone around them is getting pulled into it.

It's like another me is here, messing with the code like last time.

Except I haven't touched anything…

Okay I may have cheated at chess or messed with my backstory a bit, but still!

Nothing that should be changing people's personalities.

But everyone is acting out…

Maybe this is just what they're like? I mean, I only ever aggravated issues that were already there when I was… destroying people.

Could this be me? Or some remnant of me?

I don't know…

But I'm going to try and fix it.

Whatever this is, I have your back!

I feel fire.

Burning, endless inferno.

Its great heat rises and warms me, but its embers threaten to scorch my skin.

For I know that which the fire fends off.

Darkness.

Cold.

Void.

The fire stings and burns and blinds and chokes.

But it is better than the empty nothing of the dark.

At least, that's what the fire told me."""
